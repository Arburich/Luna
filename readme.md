# Son of Arburich

This bot was made as a side-hobby project for my own server, Alchemy Den. This is a bot made with strong single-use functionality for an Elite Dangerous Discord, and can be modified per server use.

## Getting Started

Download zip file, make sure that Node is installed, and run the index.js from your host folder. Make sure to change your config for your own private key, as well as change some of the commands that are server related. 


### Features

* Async commands
* Permission lockable commands
* API integration with EDDB, EDSM, ELITEBGS, and JEGIN
* A shop system for Discord Servers. 
* Easy to make custom commands. 
* Elite related commands.
