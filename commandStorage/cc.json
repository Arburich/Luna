It's a method of trying to control how minor factions in the game, such as Alchemy Den, interact with one another and rise to control systems or move into new locations. Everything you do in the game affects the Background Simulation, whether you know it or not. Bounties turned in from bounty hunting, trading, selling mined goods, and cartographic data all can affect how the BGS acts in a system. Some acts help the commanding faction in a system, others can work against them. Some of us work to try to use the BGS for the good of Alchemy Den.
