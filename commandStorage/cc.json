It's a method of trying to control how minor factions in the game, such as Alchemy Den, interact with one another and rise to control systems or move into new locations. Everything you do in the game affects the Background Simulation, whether you know it or not. Bounties turned in from bounty hunting, trading, selling mined goods, and cartographic data all can affect how the BGS acts in a system. Some acts help the commanding faction in a system, others can work against them. Some of us work to try to use the BGS for the good of Alchemy Den. For more information: <http://remlok-industries.fr/7143/the-complete-background-simulation-guide/?lang=en>\n\nIf you want to help Alchemy Den with BGS, or want to know more / have questions, type ``!rank Background Simulation``","farscapehi":"https://tenor.com/view/farscape-farscape-friday-farscape-tv-scifi-tv-show-scifi-tv-gif-13941777","birbday":"https://tenor.com/view/bird-parrot-papagallo-amitico-party-gif-8906272","mrpfren":"https://imgur.com/a/1tUWOWQ","4doctorhi":"https://media1.tenor.com/images/7c7a6f4fac4521b4e8766e0ea01dc753/tenor.gif","wort":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrHfdkY2V1M","shoo":"https://tenor.com/view/go-away-angry-hit-broom-run-gif-16543467","simbayeet":"https://media1.tenor.com/images/7710814b252a81a4132d8371cb9452e2/tenor.gif?itemid=17566525","jukeluv":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/466288364820234240/754519222222192670/unknown.png","bonk":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/466649460106067980/764604906312040448/video0.mov","fuel":"https://confluence.fuelrats.com/plugins/servlet/mobile?contentId=1507609#content/view/1507609","hotspots":"Here's a list of all the hotspots in Alchemy Den space. \n\nMost Notably, **a double LTD hotspot in 59 VIrginis**. \n\nThanks Jack for updating this list after it was all redone from Arb's old list post-Tritium. \n\n<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19UjxoPERThTMK10Or1cbW37cazPueFs01w7of0T4-4M/edit?usp=sharing>","lithobraking":"https://tenor.com/view/corgi-crash-excited-smash-too-excited-gif-14245030","apache":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/466276477546266625/774323651901915176/unknown.png","res":"```asciidoc\n== 59 Virginis ==\n1 :: Haz, Haz, Low, Low\n3 :: Haz, High, High\nAlchemia Virginis :: Haz, Reg\n5 :: Haz, High, Low\n7 :: Haz, Low\n8 :: Haz, High, High, Reg\n8 E :: High, Reg\n8 F :: Haz, Reg, Low\n8 G :: Haz, Haz, High, Low\n8 H :: Haz, Low, Low, Low\n9 :: Haz, Haz, Low\n\n== Hadad ==\n9 :: Haz, Reg\n\n== LHS 2887 == \n4 :: Haz, Low\n5 :: Haz\n\n== LP 493-64 ==\n2 :: Haz, Reg, Reg, Low\n4 :: Haz, Haz\n5 :: Haz, Low \n\n== LP 620-3 ==\n4 :: High\n\n== Pliny ==\nA 4 :: Haz\nA 6 :: Haz, High, High\nA 7 :: Haz, Haz, Haz, High, High\nA 8 :: Haz, High\nB 1 :: Haz, Haz, High, Low\nB 2 :: Haz, Low\nB 3 :: Reg\nB 5 :: High, Low\nB 6 :: Reg, Reg, Low\n\n== Ross 130 ==\nAB 1 :: Haz, Haz, Reg \nAB 2 :: Haz, High, High, Reg\nAB 3 :: Reg, Low\n\n== Wolf 497 == \n8 :: Low```"}
